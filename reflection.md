Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I think it is interesting but doesn't really seem to affect the classes that we have created so far, but I'm excited to see how Inheritance might effect our continuation of using these classes in the next assignment. I think Inheritance helps motivate why we use object-oriented programming which is something I've been struggling with but the layout of having subclasses feels really organized which I appreciate. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found that the instructions were very helpful, particularly in pointing to the documentation. I would recommend really trying to get familiar with the layout of the documentation because it is very beneficial.
